# Modifications for Official Assignment
My Recommendations:

Detailed Specification: Provide a more detailed description of expected behaviors and edge cases. The assignment is ambiguous right now so I do not know if we need user input or if we want to build a specific scenario. 
Extend Functionality: Include additional methods such as delete(key) or update(key, value) to broaden the scope of the database operations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of transactional systems.
Automated Testing: Integrate a suite of unit tests to automatically evaluate the correctness of the implemented functions. 
Allow for some extra credit from this assignment and I think it will be great as an official assignmen.
